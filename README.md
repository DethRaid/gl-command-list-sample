# NV_GL_command_list LWJGL sample

Sample LWJGL application showing how one might use the NV_GL_command_list extension

This application uses the extensions `NV_GL_command_list` and `ARB_GL_bindless_texture`. Additionally, it targets OpenGL 
4.5 and Java 1.8. If your system doesn't support those things, tough.
